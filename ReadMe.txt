Iris Dataset is a classical Data set used in Classification in Machine Learning for who are getting started in Machine Learning.

Iris Dataset Contains Three Species 

1. Iris-setosa     
2. Iris-versicolor   
3. Iris-virginica    

Each species contains 50 samples and total of 150 samples.

There are many classification algorithms in Machine Learning and some of them are used in this problem and they are :-

1. Logistic Regression
2. Linear Discriminant Analysis(LDA)
3. K Nearest Neighbors(KNN)
4. Decision Trees
5. Suppport Vector Classifier(SVC)

First we explore the data and understand the Insights of the data, then we will split the data into train and validation sets

Cross Validation is a technique used to evaluate the model performance by splitting the training set itself into train set and validation set and 
the algorithm which performed well can be used in our final model
